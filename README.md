# BDX I/O YouTube publisher

> CLI to publish BDX I/O talks to YouTube.

Every year talks from the [BDX I/O](https://www.bdx.io) conference are streamed live on YouTube.  
Once this is done these streams need to be splitted into individual videos for each talk.

This [Node.js](https://www.nodejs.org) CLI automates this process.

Basically the application:

- downloads the stream for each room
- splits them into invidual video for each talk, according to timestamps given
- adds an intro and an outro to every video
- uploads each video to YouTube
- adds them to an unique playlist

## Install

If you plan to use Docker just run `./build.sh` to build the image.

Otherwise you'll need two runtime requirements :

  1. [youtube-dl](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/), used to download rooms streams
  2. [ffpmeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) v3.4+, used to extract talks from streams

Then you can install dependencies using `yarn` or `npm install`.

## Usage

To upload videos you'll need to retrieve `client_id` and `client_secret` of the application to authorize access to the BDX I/O YouTube account.  
Go to the [Google developers console](https://console.developers.google.com/), select the application `bdxio-yt-publisher` and select `Identifiants`.  
Then select `Node.js` as OAuth 2.0 client and copy/paste the `client_id` and `client_secret` into `config/default.json`.  
If you need to create a new application don't forget to enable the "YouTube Data API v3" API for it.

The second step is to export the CSV file containing all the talks informations:
  
  1. Go to the Google Drive account and open the spreadsheet `Talks <YEAR>` located in the folder `6- CFP - Speakers`
  2. Export the sheet named `Vid√©os`
  3. Paste the CSV file at the root of the projet, it should be named `Talks <ANNEE>.csv`

Check that this sheet contains:

  - room in column `A`
  - id in column `C`
  - title in column `D`
  - start and end offsets in columns `E` and `H`
  - video url in column `K`

_invalid rows will be filtered out_

Put the intro and outro files to be added to each video into the [assets](./assets) directory.

Finally create a configuration file called `production.json` in the `config` directory, using `default.json` as template (see `Configuration` section below for more information).

You can use Docker to run the application, using `run.sh` script.

_Notice that you'll need to manually copy paste the OAuth authorization URL to give access to your YouTube account_

You can run the application locally, using `NODE_ENV=production yarn start` to start the processing.  
Upon start the application should ask for access to the Google account, make sure that you select the BDX I/O account, not your own Google account (unless you want to make some tests).

**Note**

When the upload of a video is finished you might have to wait some time before the next video is uploaded as YouTube needs to process the uploaded video first.

Once all the videos have been imported you just have to :

  - add all videos to a specific public playlist
  - make them public _(they are private by default in case something goes wrong)_

## Configuration

`config` folder contains configuration files.  
By default `Node.js` runs in development mode so `default.json` then `developmement.json` configuration files are used.  
You can easily add a new configuration file and then start the application using `NODE_ENV` environment variable to use your new configuration file (_default.json will still be loaded first_).

Here is the list of the existing configuration parameters :

```javascript
{
    // The CSV file to use as an input list for the talks to process.
    "csv": "test/test.csv",
    // The current year is used but defaultbut you can override it.
    "year": 2017,
    // All rooms are processed by default but you can limit the rooms to process.
    // The room names corresponds to values in the first column in the CSV file.
    "rooms": ["AmphiA", "AmphiB"],
    // CFP base URL for talks, used to retrieve additional infos for talks.
    "cfpBaseUrlTalk": "<URL>",
    // Download or not the full stream video.
    "download": true/false,
    // Extension to use for downloaded stream video files.
    // Please be aware that it must match the arguments set to download streams using youtube-dl
    // or otherwise there might be a mismatch between the file extension used here and the one youtube-dl used.
    "downloadExt": "mkv",
    // Extract talks from stream video file if set to true.
    "extract": true/false,
    // Path to the file to use for the intro (relative to the current directory).
    // You can choose to remove it but in this case don't forget to edit accordingly the ffmpeg command (see below).
    "intro": "<INTRO_PATH>",
    // Path to the file to use for the outro (relative to the current directory).
    // As for the intro you can choose to remove it, edit ffmpeg command to remove reference to it.
    "outro": "<OUTRO_PATH>",
    // Upload extracted talks to YouTube if set to true.
    "upload": true/false,
    // Title for uploaded talks. ${year} will be replaced by the conference year, ${title} by the title of the talks and ${speakers} by the name of the speakers.
    "title": "BDX I/O ${year} - ${title} - ${speakers}",
    // Configuration for YouTube.
    "youtube": {
        // The category id to apply to uploaded talks.
        // See https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/videoCategories/list for more info.
        "categoryId": "28",
        // The license to apply to uploaded talks.
        "license": "youtube/creativeCommon",
        // The visibility of the uploaded talks.
        // It is usually a good idea to set them to private first to check first that everything went fine,
        // YouTube allows to mass change visibility of videos.
        // Notice that private status means that you need to be connected to the account
        // having uploaded the video to have access to it.
        "privacyStatus": "private/public/unlisted"
    },
    // Credentials for the Google Application.
    "credentials": {
        // Client ID of the Google application.
        "client_id": "***",
        // Client secret of the Google application.
        "client_secret": "***",
        // Redirect URI to retrieve the access token (for now changing it will break the upload!).
        "redirect_uri": "http://localhost:5000/oauth2callback"
    }
}
```

You may also set the `ffmpeg` arguments used to extract and encode talks from the streams.  
For this you need to edit the file [ffmpeg.args](./ffmpeg.args).

If you're running the application on your computer you might want to customize the encoder used in order to use 
available hardware acceleration (this won't work if you're using a Docker container).  
For example on macOS you may replace `libx264` by `h264_videotoolbox` to use [VideoToolbox](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/videotoolbox).

By default the following arguments are used:
```bash
-y -i "${intro}" -ss ${start} -to ${end} -i "${stream}" -loop 1 -t 7 -framerate 25 -i "${outro}" -t 7 -f lavfi -i anullsrc=r=44100:cl=stereo \
  -filter_complex "[0:v] fade=in:0:25, fade=out:250:25 [faded-intro]; \
  [1:v] fade=in:0:25, fade=out:st=${fadeOutStartTime}:d=1 [faded-talk-video]; \
  [1:a] afade=t=in:ss=0:d=1, afade=t=out:st=${fadeOutStartTime}:d=1 [faded-talk-audio]; \
  [2:v] fade=in:0:25, fade=out:150:25 [faded-outro]; \
  [faded-intro] [0:a] [faded-talk-video] [faded-talk-audio] [faded-outro] [3:a] concat=n=3:v=1:a=1 [v] [a]" \
  -map "[v]" -map "[a]" -c:v libx264 -crf 17 -c:a aac -b:a 192k "${output}"
```

Basically this add an intro and an outro (from an image), extract the talk from the stream, add some fade in and fade out effects and outputs to a single file.

The application will replace the variables by their values when executing the command :
  - `${intro}` is the path to the intro file
  - `${start}` and `${end}` are the start and end timestamps of the talk
  - `${stream}` is the path to the stream for the room
  - `${outro}` is the path to the outro file
  - `${fadeOutStartTime}` is the timestamp (in seconds) indicating where to start fading out
  - `${output}` is the path to the extracted talk file

In details (note that in `ffmpeg` options set before an input are relative only to this input):

  - `-y` overwrites the output file
  - `-i` defines an input
  - `-ss` asks `ffmpeg` to start the input at the specified timestamp
  - `-to` asks `ffmpeg` to stop reading the input at the specified timestamp. This parameter and the previous one are doing the actual extraction of the talk.
  - `-loop 1` is used to loop over an image (this option is specific to images muxer and demuxer)
  - `-t 7` limits the duration of the input. In our case it allows to create a video of 7 seconds for the image input
  - `-framerate` defines the framerate of the video generated from the image
  - `-f lavfi` tells `ffmpeg` the format of the next input (libavfilter)
  - `-i anullsrc=r=44100:cl=stereo` defines a null audio input with 2 channels (stereo) and a frequency of 44100 Hz. This is necessary to concatenate streams later as our outro video generated from an image has no sound stream. This is also why we previously told `ffmpeg` the format of the input.
  - `filter_complex` is used to create a complex filter!
  - `[0:v]` selects the video stream of the first video (inputs and streams are indexed from 0, as usual). We can use `v` to mean `video`, `ffmpeg` automatically selects the best video stream and in our case we only have one. Using an index would have been wiser if there had been multiple video streams.
  - `fade=in:0:25, fade=out:250:25` we apply a fade in effet to the 25 first frame and a fade out effect to the last 25 frames
  - `[faded-intro]` the output is called `faded-intro` in order to be reused later
  - `[1:v]` we select the video stream from the second input (the YouTube stream)
  - `fade=in:0:25, fade=out:st=${fadeOutStartTime}:d=1` we apply a fade in and a fade out effects to the video. Contrary to the intro we specify the fade out start time as seconds as we don't know exactly the number of frames of the extracted talk
  - `[1:a] afade=t=in:ss=0:d=1, afade=t=out:st=${fadeOutStartTime}:d=1 [faded-talk-audio];` just does the same fade in and fade out effects for the audio. We only do that for the talk as the intro doesn't have audio at the beginning nor at the ending and the outro has no audio at all
  - we do the same thing for the outro we did for the intro, a fade in and a fade out effect as we know exactly the number of frames (duration x framerate = 7 x 25 = 175).
  - `[faded-intro] [0:a] [faded-talk-video] [faded-talk-audio] [faded-outro] [3:a]` we select all the streams to process, the faded intro, its audio stream (`[0:a]`), the faded talk and its faded audio stream and finally the faded outro and its audio stream (`[3:a]` and not `[2:a]` as we generated a fourth audio input)
  - `concat=n=3:v=1:a=1 [v] [a]` uses the concat filter, specifying the number of streams to concatenate and naming the resulting video and audio streams (respectively `v` and `a`)
  - `-map "[v]" -map "[a]" ${output}` at last allows to map the previously resulting streams `v` and `a` to the output file
  - `-c:v libx264 -crf 17` selects the libx264 encoder for the video, using a constant rate factor of 17 to encode the video, considered as almost lossless (see https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Encode/H.264 for more information)
  - `-c:a aac -b:a 192k` selects the aac encoder for the audio, using a bitrate of 192 kbit/s
